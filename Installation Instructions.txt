NOTE: 

This tool is under development and it will ask you to update several times during the rpoject 

1) Place the pkl_pipeline folder where you want it to be.
for example: "C:/Users/YOU/Documents/maya/scripts".

This folder is a good place to keep it, but it can be anywhere.

2) Once you have the pkl_pipeline folder where you want it to be,
then just drag and drop the "install.mel" file into Maya viewport.

This will add the tool to the current shelf.

The tool was only tested in maya 2018 to 2024

Please, consider support me so I can make updates in the future and develope more stuff.
